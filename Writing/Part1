A restaurant has placed an advertisement for waiters and waitress in your local newspaper. Write an email:

- applying for the job
- explaining what you are currently doing
- describing the suitablity for this area of work
- saying when you can attend an interview.

Dear Sir,

I am writing in response to your advertisement for waitress staff at St Taverna. Most of my waitressing experience has been at the Dupont Inn where I worked for three years before returning for the school. I've attached my resume and references; however, there are couple of things I'd like to highlight.

Firstly, I speak fluent Italian and, since many of you customers are Italian, I'm sure they would be thrilled to find that your resturant's authenticity extends beyond its food all the way down to its staff. That would be really good for business.

Secondly, during my recent studies in catering management I have understood just how important it is for resturants to be customer focused. To me, that means that its employee's responsibilities include making every effort to maintain a clean, friendly, and efficient environment.

With my fluency in italian, catering diploma, and broad experience, I feel I would be good fit for this oppurtunity; therefore I hope you take a moment to review my attached resume. Since my course is now finished, I would be available to meet with you at any time and work both lunch and sinner shifts.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Oshan Shrestha
